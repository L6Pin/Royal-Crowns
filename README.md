<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>The project is a reimagination of the local sports club "Royal Crowns" <a href="http://kraljevskekrune.weebly.com/">website</a>.
   The reason for there not being a tablet and desktop version is that I wanted to learn React Router and implement a search by name function in the "Find a member" page. After doing so,
    I deemed it not to be important to complete the rest of the website as this is just a learning project.
